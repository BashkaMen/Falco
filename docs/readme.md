# Documentation

Welcome to Falco's documentation, visit the [getting started](get-started.md) page for installation and a brief overview. There is also a more detailed [Tutorial](tutorial.md) that shows how to create a small but complete application with Falco. The rest of the docs describe each component of Falco in detail.


## Guides

Falco depends only on the high-performance base components of .NET and ASP.NET Core, and provides a toolset to build a working full-stack web application. This section of the documentation explains the different parts of Falco and how they can be used, customized, and extended. Beyond Falco itself, look for community-maintained extensions to add even more functionality.
