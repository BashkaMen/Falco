# Documentation

Welcome to Falco's documentation, visit the [getting started](get-started.md) page for installation and a brief overview. There is also a more detailed [Tutorial](tutorial.md) that shows how to create a small but complete application with Falco. The rest of the docs describe each component of Falco in detail.

Falco is a toolkit for building fast, functional-first and fault-tolerant web applications using F#. Built upon the high-performance components of ASP.NET Core, and provides a toolset to build a working full-stack web application.
